Project 4&5 
This project is a survey conducted by 10 people of different ages, gender, and education level about their opinion on the mental health epidemics that we are facing today. The questions are what do they like about modern human life and what do they dislike about modern human life, as well as some factors that cause mental health in a family: mother, father, and children. The survey was done with the consent of the individual through a Google survey form, where they can answer the question anonymously and with no pressure to what they wrote. The data was collected little to no changes to the what they have presented in the survey.
